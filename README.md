Been about 11 years since hov dropped this song<br/>
And elevens a lucky number so i had to bring along<br/>
Some mixtape style from ennio morricone<br/>
Thats american for bad pronounciation<br/>
Im a nation up and onto myself<br/>
And im puffin on that el rond, not hubbard, the elf (the forest)<br/>
Dr brule for your health<br/>
Get you some cryptocurrency and start building your wealth<br/>
Had some runins with antis gunnin<br/>
Trying to jack my paper for some texts i sent<br/>
I had that wavecom chipset paying my rent<br/>
Cuz i was SMS spamming the block for events<br/>
But thats past tense had to stop with that outbound<br/>
The spammers in the game knew the day to get out now<br/>
Spamming a little crazy amount now<br/>
NowSMS got em launching on countdown<br/>

S P A M<br/>
Send it every day get paid and then<br/>

Load another campaign and do it again<br/>

Some hit the inbox they contact mailing<br/>
Some are going super saiyan on the snapchat<br/>
And bot traffic ain't changed a bit since the 90s<br/>
Scripts are just smarter and its harder to bind these<br/>
Sockets correctly can't do it directly<br/>
The proxy requirements are set respectfully<br/>
So newbies in the game got a barrier to entry<br/>
Ain't no one coming straight out of WoW pushing a bentley<br/><br/>

But im a teacher of tactics spread solution<br/>
To students of the game though the fames elusive<br/>
Im banging crypto when im spitting acoustic<br/>
Cuz this game has got a case of the loose tip<br/>
Read between the lines draw conclusions<br/>
Lifting the shroud off these false illusions<br/>
This computer is a weapon of mine<br/>
And i can run the globe in polynomial time<br/>

Send it every day get paid and then<br/>
S P A M<br/>
Load another campaign and do it again<br/><br/>

All the programs in my taskbar stack hard<br/>
Cuz we mastered the art of the gas card<br/>
The art of the garcinia diet the art of cloaking<br/>
Art of constant contact when your upstreams broken<br/>
And when the fat lady's spoken<br/>
You gotta hit em with that tracking token<br/>
Then retarget em iframe the pages you own<br/>
Circlejerking like a webring on geocities home<br/><br/>

Like python turn my print into function<br/>
Turn it into songs that these nerds still bumpin<br/>
Got the soundtrack to inspire the gumption<br/>
In a lost generation of twenty-somethings<br/>
Messiah of mailing the earl of EPC<br/>
Alpha omicron lambda fraternity<br/>
Shouts to all the people that burned me<br/>
All the bullshit in your world dont concern me; lee ermey<br/>
