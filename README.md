Been about 11 years since hov dropped this song
And elevens a lucky number so i had to bring along
Some mixtape style from ennio morricone
Thats american for bad pronounciation
Im a nation up and onto myself
And im puffin on that el rond, not hubbard, the elf (the forest)
Dr brule for your health
Get you some cryptocurrency and start building your wealth
Had some runins with antis gunnin
Trying to jack my paper for some texts i sent
I had that wavecom chipset paying my rent
Cuz i was SMS spamming the block for events
But thats past tense had to stop with that outbound
The spammers in the game knew the day to get out now
Spamming a little crazy amount now
NowSMS got em launching on countdown

Some hit the inbox they contact mailing
Some are going super saiyan on the snapchat
And bot traffic ain't changed a bit since the 90s
Scripts are just smarter and its harder to bind these
Sockets correctly can't do it directly
The proxy requirements are set respectfully
So newbies in the game got a barrier to entry
Ain't no one coming straight out of WoW pushing a bentley

But im a teacher of tactics spread solution
To students of the game though the fames elusive
Im banging crypto when im spitting acoustic
Cuz this game has got a case of the loose tip
Read between the lines draw conclusions
Lifting the shroud off these false illusions
This computer is a weapon of mine
And i can run the globe in polynomial time

All the programs in my taskbar stack hard
Cuz we mastered the art of the gas card
The art of the garcinia diet the art of cloaking
Art of constant contact when your upstreams broken
And when the fat lady's spoken
You gotta hit em with that tracking token
Then retarget em iframe the pages you own
Circlejerking like a webring on geocities home

Like python turn my print into function
Turn it into songs that these nerds still bumpin
Got the soundtrack to inspire the gumption
In a lost generation of twenty-somethings
Messiah of mailing the earl of EPC
Alpha omicron lambda fraternity
Shouts to all the people that burned me
All the bullshit in your world dont concern me; lee ermey
